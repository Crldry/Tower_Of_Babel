          In this story you'll see how God handles pride and how badly he wants
          to stop it from happening. It all started with a King named Nimrod.
          Everything was going great. Everyone in the whole world spoke the same
          language. Some of the people ended up living in a place called
          Babylonia. Then King Nimrod decided he wanted to be famous. He wanted
          everyone to know him and how great he was. He convinced the people
          that lived in Babylonia that, they too could be great if they built a
          tower that went all the way to heaven.

          So the people went to work making bricks for the Tower of Babel. It
          was hard work but the people wanted everyone to know that they made
          the tower that reached heaven, so they just worked that much harder.
          The people also convinced themselves that by building the tower that
          would So the people went to work making bricks for the Tower of Babel.
          It was stay united. Since they already spoke the same language, now
          they would be building the tower together. Their pride had taken over
          and all they were thinking about was that they'd be known in all the
          world for building the biggest and best tower ever.

          God could see what was happening all along, but decided to come down
          to earth and see the tower the people were building. God could tell
          the people's hearts were more focused on themselves and the tower than
          on him. He was very disappointed and angry with them. God said, "I see
          that the people think they can do anything because they all speak the
          same language. They have already begun to turn away from me and soon
          there won't be anything good left, all they'll do is sin. I will mix
          up their language so they won't understand each other, this way they
          won't be able to work together to sin against me."

          After God said this the people could no longer understand each other.
          It seemed like they were babbling and making funny noises. All the
          people suddenly spoke different languages, some spoke French, some
          Spanish, others Chinese, plus many other languages. They were very
          confused. This was the beginning of the languages. Imagine what
          would've happened if the people didn't try to build the tower in the
          first place and they focused on God instead. Maybe we would all speak
          the same language today.

          From there the Lord scattered the people all over the whole earth.
          It's interesting because when the people starting building the tower
          of Babel, Babel meant "gateway to God" but after God mixed up their
          language it meant "confusion". Even the word babble that we use today
          is said to come from that day when everyone was babbling with
          confusion.
